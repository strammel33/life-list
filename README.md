Life List is an app for birders of all skill levels! Life List serves two purposes: to log birding events (called records) and to keep track of a birder's life list. A birder's life list all birds sighted and identified by the birder.

***
To use Life List, log in with a Google account and make your first life list bird entry! For every bird you add to your life list, you can return to it and add information about individual sightings. Then, make your first birding record. The records can be as brief or in-depth as the birder chooses - it's your record after all. Once you make your record you can associate birds from your life list with it to chronicle what you saw that day.

### IceBox Goals:
Life lists can take many iterations and scopes. It is not uncommon for a birder to have several life lists (i.e. an annual list, a regional list, a national list, etc). Ultimately I want to build Life List out to support several lists with overlapping species. In the same vein; I want to relate individual sightings of birds to records to produce a more holistic birding event record.

Addtionally:
* List search functionality
* List sorting functionality (alphabetical, chronological, granularity)
* User interaction: friending other birders, seeing their lists, commenting on records
* Users can add images to their records or sightings
* Small screen functionality/responsiveness
